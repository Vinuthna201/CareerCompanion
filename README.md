## Security

This project implements secure API key management:

-  API keys are stored server-side only
-  Frontend never exposes sensitive credentials
-  All API calls are proxied through a secure backend
-  Configuration files are gitignored

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Google Gemini API key

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd career-companion
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure API keys**
   ```bash
   # Copy the example config file
   cp config.example.js config.js
   
   # Edit config.js and add your actual API keys
   # Replace YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE with your real API key
   ```

4. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Open your browser**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

### Production Deployment

1. **Install production dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install --production
   ```

2. **Set environment variables** (optional)
   ```bash
   export PORT=3000
   ```

3. **Start the production server**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## API Configuration

### Google Gemini API

1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Create a new API key
3. Add the key to your `config.js` file:

       GEMINI_API_KEY: "your-actual-api-key-here"
   };
   ```

## Security Best Practices

- Never commit API keys to version control
- Use environment variables in production
- Implement rate limiting for API endpoints
- Validate all user inputs
- Use HTTPS in production
